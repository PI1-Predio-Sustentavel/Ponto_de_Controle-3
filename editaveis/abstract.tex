 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The discipline Projeto Integrator 1, from the Faculdade do Gama - Universidade de
   Bras√≠lia, aims to promote the integration between the various engineering
   present on the campus in a common project. In this way, it enables students
   to work on several highly needed skills, such as group work and the ability
   to lead groups.

   This document will present the project Sustainable and
   Intelligent Building, carried out by Turma A. The focus is to solve problems
   faced by the faculty, such as poorly planned lighting,
   archaic presence control system, and energy and water waste.

   The Sustainable and Intelligent Building consists of using energy sources and sustainable
   materials in its development. By means of software and electronic systems it
   is intended to monitor water and energy waste, thus building a Smart Grid
   system on campus. In addition, it will create an access control system that
   monitors the flow of people, and a more modern presence control system.
